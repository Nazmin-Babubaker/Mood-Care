## The Problem Statement  
In a fast-paced world, emotions often take a backseat.Mental Helath is often underlooked. We all face stress, boredom, loneliness, and other mood swings that impact our mental health. What if you could get an instant pick-me-up with just one click?

## The Solution  
Moodesh offers a fun, simple way to manage your emotions. Based on your selected mood, the website suggests activities ranging from playing games to engaging in mindfulness exercises. Itâ€™s like having a virtual cheerleader in your pocket!(Who wouldn't mind having an emotional support within our hands reach...)
